# clipperlib-refactored
This version of Clipper has been refactored to best match our in-house projects and use cases.  

The original single-file library has been split into multiple files, any classes or functionality not used by StagPoint have been deleted, object pooling has been added, and numerous (mostly insignificant) changes have been made to the codebase.
