# clipperlib-refactored
This version of Angus Johnson's Clipper Library has been refactored to best match our in-house projects and use cases.  

The original single-file library has been split into multiple files, any classes or functionality not used by StagPoint have been deleted, object pooling has been added, and numerous (mostly insignificant) changes have been made to the codebase.

The original Clipper Library, which is available in several different languages, can be obtained at:
